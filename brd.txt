Project Description
-------------------
Goal -> To estimate number of passengers traveling in a bus.
Platform -> Android App with a AWS/other backend.

Android App
-----------
1. UI
 a. Simple UI which can take a username as input username once chosen should be immutable
 this username will be used to identify the user at backend
 b.A status bar to show number of app users in the bus ?

2. Services
 a. Location Service
 Periodically (2hz ?) collect speed, bearing and lat-long data and upload to backend every min.

  b. Ground Truth Service
  To know ground truth of many people are there in the bus use bluetooth service.
  The app checks if its bluetooth is discoverable ( check when app starts ?) and periodically scans for devices.
  The scan list is timestamped and sent to backend.


Backend
----------
1. Collection -> collect all info into db ( data collection for analysis)
    db schema ->
2. Real time tracking/clustering algorithm.
   From speed data maintain a window/graph of acceleration and break spikes for each user ??
   a. cluster users based on location 15m radius ( location centroid is taken as bus position)
   b. prune or move users from clusters if they have mismatched accel/break window ??

frontend ?
---------
simple webpage to show buses on a map and no of passengers




Json format:
------------
{"user":"username",   // users name
  "location_records":{"lat":1312,"long":12312,"speed":1312,"bearing":12312,"timestamp":} ,  // send location data every 30sec
  "bluetooth_record":["myap","ap1", "ap2", "ap3",]    // send bluetooth record every min
                      // "myap" should be the users bluetooth ap/mac id
  }
